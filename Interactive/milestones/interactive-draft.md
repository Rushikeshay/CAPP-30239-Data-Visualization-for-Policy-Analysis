# Global Protest Tracker 

Rushikesh Jadhav

## Goal

The goal of this tool is to allow the user to explore Carnegie Endowment for International Peace’s global protest data. The user will be able to explore the number of protests that took place around the world and their characteristics. The goal of this project has not changed.

## Data Challenges

There are no data challenges as of yet. The dataset is relatively clean. I just had to create new variables for month and year.

## Walk Through

The user can hover over and click on any country on the map to see a list of "protest cards" that show characteristics such as name, start date, the country’s freedom rating, triggers, and a total of nine characteristics.

## Questions

1. My next step is to create filters. My initial attempts were unsuccessful. I have decided to proceed with only a year filter so I can allow the user to filter the data by year. Are there any example project codes I can refer to for creating such filters?

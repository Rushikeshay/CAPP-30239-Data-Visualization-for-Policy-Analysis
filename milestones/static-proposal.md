## Description

Idea 1: Examining the effectiveness of the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) (a crop insurance scheme in India) at the district level. I plan to explore this dataset on its own to understand the distribution and uptake rates of crop insurance. Additionally, I can investigate how rainfall patterns influence insurance participation to uncover potential relationships between environmental variability and farmer behavior.
Idea 2: I would like to analyze the evolution of digital payment systems in India using daily transaction data from 2020 to 2024. It focuses on major payment channels such as UPI, NEFT, RTGS, IMPS, and card payments, examining both transaction volume and value over time.

## Data Sources

### Data Source 1: PMFBY District Level

URL: https://indiadataportal.com/p/pradhan-mantri-fasal-bima-yojana-pmfby/r/moafw-pmfby-dt-sn-syx

Size: 6161 rows, 27 columns

Description: Introduced in 2016, this government scheme provides insurance coverage and financial support to farmers in the event of crop loss caused by natural calamities, pests, or diseases. The dataset includes district-level information on loan and insurance disbursements, coverage by farmer demographics like gender, caste, and farm size, and scheme participation from 2018 to 2022.

### Data Source 2: Daily Rainfall Data - District Level

URL: https://indiadataportal.com/p/climate-data/r/wris-daily_rainfall_district-dt-dl-imd

Size: 3577399 rows, 9 columns

Description: This dataset provides daily, district-level rainfall measurements across India from 2018 to 2022. It can be used to analyze weather variability, seasonal patterns, and extreme events. The data allows us to explore agricultural or policy outcomes using rain as an explanetory variable.

### Data Source 3: The Resurve Bank of India Digital Payments

Size: 1768 rows, 49 columns

Description: This dataset captures daily transaction volume and value for key payment systems operated by the National Payments Corporation of India, including UPI, NEFT, RTGS, IMPS, and others. Spanning 2020 to 2024 it provides granular insights into the growth and shifts in Indiaâ€™s digital payments ecosystem.

## Questions

1. I am considering combining the rainfall and insurance datasets to explore how changes in rainfall affect insurance uptake. Is it feasible/recommended to merge and analyze these together?
2. The digital payments dataset is unrelated to the other two. I am deciding between focusing on insurance and rainfall, or digital transactions. Which direction do you think would make for a better visualization project?

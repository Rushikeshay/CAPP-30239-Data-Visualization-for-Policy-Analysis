# Examining Crop Insurance Scheme from India

Rushikesh Jadhav

### What is your current goal? Has it changed since the proposal?
My goal remains to analyze how rainfall patterns and farmer demographics influence crop insurance uptake across Indian states. While the core objective hasn't changed, I've recognized limitations in my explanatory variables and have expanded my dataset to include more comprehensive farmer population data for better penetration rate calculations.

### Are there data challenges you are facing? Are you currently depending on mock data?

- I am having trouble create choropleth maps. I have removed the code from this file but I will seek help soon. 
I've successfully integrated additional real data from the 2015-16 Agriculture Census to establish accurate baseline farmer populations per state. 
    - RAJYA SABHA SESSION - 265 UNSTARRED QUESTION No 1281. ANSWERED ON, 2nd August 2024. Data Figures are in Number. Source - Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare (Agriculture Census 2015-16). https://www.data.gov.in/resource/stateut-wise-total-number-small-and-marginal-operational-holdings-farmers-country-31st
- However, I'm currently facing technical challenges with choropleth map generation using district-level shapefiles, which I plan to resolve through TA visits.

### What form do you envision your final narrative taking? (e.g. An article incorporating the images? A poster? An infographic?)
- I envision a comprehensive policy review that incorporates these visualizations to assess the effectiveness and equity of India's crop insurance programs. The narrative will evaluate whether current schemes adequately serve vulnerable farming communities and respond appropriately to climate risks like rainfall variability.

### Description 

Chart 1 
- Shows which social groups benefit most from crop insurance, revealing whether marginalized communities have equitable access to agricultural safety nets.

Chart 2 
- Demonstrates if insurance programs primarily serve marginal/small farmers as intended, or if coverage skews toward larger landholders.

Chart 3 
- Tests the maini hypothesis of whether farmers in rain-dependent regions show higher insurance uptake, indicating rational risk management behavior.

Chart 4 
- Reveals temporal patterns in insurance enrollment, showing if uptake aligns with monsoon seasons when crop failure risk peaks. Also shows longterm increase or decrease in uptake. 

Chart 5 
- Examines gender disparities in insurance access, highlighting whether women farmers are adequately covered. I am considering addign numbers of women and men farmer per state to provide more context. 

Chart 6 
- Compares insurance penetration across different farm size categories, showing if the program effectively reaches the most smallholders.

Chart 7 
- Tracks how states' insurance performance changes, identifying states that taking a lead on agri innsurance. I am considering adding 3 facet charts for 4 states showing temporal changes. 

Chart 8
- Shows which states have outperformed others in insurance penetration. This helps us observe the overall trends across the country. 

Chart 9
- Provides granular view of how rainfall levels correlate with insurance adoption across different penetration rates. 

Chart 10 
- This helps us see which states have the largest gross premium helping us understand which states have been prioratizing agri insurance. It would be curious to split this by state and GOI shares and see whether it was the GOI or the states pushing for more insurance plans.

# PMFBY and The Northeast 

Rushikesh Jadhav 

## Description

This project analyzes enrollment patterns in India's Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), country's flagship crop insurance scheme launched in 2016. The analysis examines how insurance adoption varies across India's agricultural zones.
Goal: To understand why Northeast India, despite facing severe implementation challenges including achieves relatively high insurance penetration rates compared to other regions. The analysis investigates the role of the central government's premium subsidy in the Northeast, while exploring limitations of subsidy-driven agricultural policy interventions.
